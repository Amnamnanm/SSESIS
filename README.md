# SSESIS
A tool to make AI smarter by advanced prompt engeneering and an app to use this sytem locally

Currently, SSESIS architecture ONLY works on Google Gemini models. Any other models such as: ChatGPT, Grok, Claude and others lack context and knowledge to follow complex instructions.
It is NOT reccomended to use all commands at once. Reccomended commands are: /WHIS /evolution /10
More commands will overload AI and it will likely give you worse answers. The more advanced AI becomes the more commands it can handle at once. Best works on Gemini 3 Pro and 2.5 Pro via API or by creating a Gem bot with custom instructions in Web App

MAS can work with any LLM, but for any complex task it's highly reccomended to use at least an 8B model. Models under 8B lack knowledge and often break due to instructions being too complex for them. The model is only loaded once, so it shouldn't be a problem.
